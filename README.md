# Clock-App

The challenge

The challenge is to build out a clock application using following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) to set the city and country underneath the time
- [Quotes API](https://api.quotable.io/random/) to generate random quotes.
